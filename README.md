 Building an Interactive PDF Splitter Application with Python and Tkinter 

Project I recently worked on: a desktop application that splits a single PDF into two parts using Python, Tkinter, and the Spire.PDF library.

Handling large PDFs can be challenging, especially when specific pages need to be extracted into smaller files for streamlined usage. 
Instead of relying on third-party tools, I decided to create a custom GUI-based application that empowers users to split PDFs with just a few clicks.
